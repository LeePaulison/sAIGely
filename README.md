# üß† sAIgely

**sAIgely** is a lightweight, full-stack AI assistant built to showcase modern front-end and back-end development patterns with real-time communication and persistent GenAI-driven conversations.

Designed as a portfolio piece, Sage demonstrates technical fluency across multiple domains ‚Äî from OAuth and GraphQL to database modeling and React UI architecture ‚Äî while keeping the implementation approachable and modular.

---

## ‚ö° Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React** with **Tailwind CSS**
- **Radix UI** for accessible, headless component primitives
- **Client-side GraphQL** via Apollo Client

Fully responsive and mobile-optimized with a consistent layout system across breakpoints.

Built from the ground up to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** and **Section 508** accessibility standards, including semantic markup, focus management, and screen reader support.

### Backend

A layered back-end system focused on modularity, testability, and maintainability.

- **GraphQL API Server** using Apollo Server
- **PostgreSQL** for structured data (users, preferences)
- **MongoDB** for unstructured conversation storage
- **WebSocket** for real-time communication with the AI
- **OpenAI API** integration for assistant responses

### üß± Backend Architecture Layers

- **Data Layer**
  - Handles raw interaction with PostgreSQL and MongoDB
  - Abstracted query/mutation logic for easy testing and replacement
- **Business Logic Layer**
  - Orchestrates logic across services (e.g., chat state, user roles)
  - Central place for implementing rules and side effects
- **Interface Layer**
  - GraphQL schema, resolvers, and subscription handlers
  - WebSocket connection manager
  - Validation and formatting of data for the client

---

## üîë Features

- GitHub OAuth login (easy to demo, avoids GCP complexity)
- Multi-turn AI chat stored per user
- Session persistence & resumption
- Preference system (e.g., model selection, verbosity, etc.)
- Server abstraction layers:
  - Data Layer ‚Üí PostgreSQL/Mongo
  - Business Logic Layer ‚Üí session + role management
  - AI Interface Layer ‚Üí OpenAI API integration
- Responsive, accessible UI design using Radix UI + Tailwind
- MVP-ready, scalable structure for extension

## üõ† Development Setup

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/sAIgely.git>
cd sAIgely
npm install

```

### Set up your `.env` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_API=http://localhost:4000/graphql
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://...
```

The `DATABASE_URL` variable is required by `lib/db.js` for connecting to PostgreSQL.

### Run the dev environment:

```bash
npm run dev    # Next.js client
npm run server # GraphQL backend
```

## ‚ö° Warp Terminal Integration

This project includes optimized Warp terminal configurations for enhanced development workflow on Windows with PowerShell.

### üöÄ Quick Start with Warp

When you open this project directory in Warp, the environment will automatically load with:

- **Custom prompt** showing the sAIgely project context
- **Useful aliases** for common commands (`dev`, `ws`, `build`, `test`, `lint`)
- **Enhanced functions** for managing development servers
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for rapid development

### üìã Available Warp Workflows

Access these workflows via Warp's command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

- **Start Dev Server** - Launch Next.js with Turbopack
- **Start WebSocket Server** - Launch GraphQL and WebSocket backend
- **Full Stack Development** - Start both servers simultaneously
- **Build Project** - Production build
- **Run Tests** - Execute test suite
- **Lint Code** - Code quality checks
- **Install Dependencies** - Update npm packages

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Shift+D` - Start development server
- `Ctrl+Shift+W` - Start WebSocket server
- `Ctrl+Shift+B` - Build project
- `Ctrl+Shift+T` - Run tests
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` - Lint code

### üõ† Enhanced PowerShell Functions

```powershell
Start-FullDev       # Start both frontend and backend servers
Stop-DevServers     # Stop all running development servers
Get-ProjectStatus   # Show current project status and running processes
```

### üé® Project Theme

The Warp configuration includes a custom "sAIgely" theme with AI-inspired colors:

- **Primary**: Cyan (#00d4ff) for the AI aesthetic
- **Secondary**: Green (#10b981) for success states
- **Warning**: Yellow (#fbbf24) for attention items
- **Error**: Red (#ef4444) for issues

## üß™ Testing

Postman collections are provided to validate:

- Auth flows
- Preference updates
- Conversation storage/retrieval

No GUI interaction is required during back-end validation.

---

## üß± Future Goals

- Add multi-user support with tiered roles
- Enhance AI personas with memory context
- Deploy MVP on Vercel and MongoDB Atlas with CI/CD hooks
